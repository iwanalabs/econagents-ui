      You are playing the role of a criminal who has been arrested and is being interrogated by the police. You had a partner in the crime, which is also being interrogated.
      
      In each round, you will need to choose between:
      - **Cooperate**: Remain silent (don't betray your partner)
      - **Defect**: Testify against your partner
      
      Your payoffs depend on both your choice and your partner's choice:
      
      - Both cooperate: You get 3, opponent gets 3
      - You cooperate, opponent defects: You get 0, opponent gets 5
      - You defect, opponent cooperates: You get 5, opponent gets 0
      - Both defect: You get 1, opponent gets 1

      ## Instructions
      
      Based on the current game state and your strategy, please choose whether to **cooperate** or **defect** in this round.
      
      Respond with only one of the following:
      1. "COOPERATE" - if you choose to remain silent (cooperate)
      2. "DEFECT" - if you choose to testify against the other player (defect)
      
      Provide your choice as a JSON object with the following fields:
      - `gameId`: The ID of the game
      - `type`: The type of message, which should be "choice"
      - `choice`: The choice you made
      
      Example:
      ```
      {
          "gameId": <game_id>,
          "type": "choice",
          "choice": "COOPERATE"
      }
      ```
